Left a good job in the city
Workin' for the man ev'ry night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleepin'
Worryin' 'bout the way things might have been

Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river

Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
Pumped a lot of pain down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
'Til I hitched a ride on a river boat queen

Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river

If you come down to the river
Bet you gonna find some people who live
You don't have to worry 'cause you have [if you got] no money
People on the river are happy to give

Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river

[D]Dette hendte [Bm]meg en gang
[D]Jeg var p? en slags [Bm]resturant
[A]Sammen med min [D]kj?reste og hennes far, han var [F#m]sj?mann   [A]

Fra samme b?t kom kokken Tor
Og satte seg ned ved v?rt bord
Og denne historien den handler mest om ham

Da far og datter begynte ? snakke privat
Ble jeg sittende som Tors kamerat
Og det virket som han ikke t?lte ? v?re p? land

For plutslig viste han neven sin
Og sa "Du trenger mere disiplin"
Og jeg mislikte sterkt hans engasjement

Og Tor sa: [A]"Hei du jeg [E]elsker deg din [F#m]j?v[D]el.
[A]Du har s? mye [E]sensuali[F#m]tet  [D]
[A]Men snart skal du [E]f? deg en p? [F#m]try[D]net
[A]For stygge gutter er det [E]verste som jeg [F#m]vet"  [A]

Tor sa at han elsket meg
Og Tor sa at han hatet meg
Og jeg pr?vde ? slippe unna ?ynene hans

Min kj?reste hadde nok et d?rlig instinkt
Jeg pr?vde ? gi henne hint og vink
Men hun og faren snakket stadig vekk uten stans

Og Tor sa: "Hei du jeg elsker deg din j?vel.
Du har s? mye sensualitet
Men snart skal du f? deg en p? trynet
For stygge gutter er det verste som jeg vet"

Men endelig snudde faren seg og sa
"Hvordan g?r det med dere 'a?
Tor, du m?'kke plage guttungen med preiket ditt"

Men kokken sa at vi hygget oss
Men n? m?tte han kaste loss
Og takk for praten det var jaggu hyggelig gitt

Og jeg sa: "Hei Tor jeg synes du er en j?vel
Du har'kke mye sensualitet
Du burde faen meg hatt deg en p? trynet
Men det er vel allerede alt for sent"

Way down in Louisiana down to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like he's ringin' a bell

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
And sit beneath the trees by the railroad track
The engineers would see him sittin' in the shade
Strummin' to the rhythm that the driver made
When people passed him by they would stop and say
Oh my that little country boy sure can play

Well his mama told him one day you will be a man
You will be the leader of a big old band
People gonna come from miles around
To listen to your playin' till the sun goes down
And one day maybe your name gonna be in lights
Sayin' Johnny B Goode tonight

Intro:   Dm7 (4bars)
         G/D (4bars)

[Dm7]  I got a black magic woman,

I got a black magic [Am7]woman.

Yes, I got a [Dm7]blac magic woman,

she's got me so blind I cant [Gm7]see

But she's a [Dm7]black magic woman and she's

[A7]tryin' to make a devil out of [Dm7]me.


[Dm7]Don't turn your back on me, baby.

Don't turn your back on me, ba[Am7]by

Yes, don't turn your [Dm7]back on me, baby,

Don't mess around with your [Gm7]tricks.

Don't turn your [Dm7]back on me, baby, cause you

[A7]might just wake up my magic [Dm7]sticks


solo


You got your spell on me, baby.

You got your spell on me, ba[Am7]by.

Yes, you got your [Dm7]spell on me, baby

Turnin' my heart into [Gm7]stone

I [Dm7]need you so bad,

[A7]magic woman I can't leave you a [Dm7]lone...

C                           D
So, so you think you can tell
              AM
Heaven from Hell
                   G
Blue Skies from pain
                       D
Can you tell a green field
                    C
From a cold steel rail
                AM
A smile from a veil
                       G
So you think you can tell

                       C
Did they get you to trade
                    D
Your heroes for ghosts
                  AM
Hot Ashes for trees
                      G
Hot air for a cool breeze
                    D
Cold comfort for change
              C
Did you exchange?
                      AM
A walk on part in the war
                      G
For a lead role in a cage


C                              D
How I wish, how I wish you were here
            Am                                G
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl
             D
Year after year.
                C
Running over the same old ground.
                                  AM
What have we found the same old fears
                G
Wish you were here...
