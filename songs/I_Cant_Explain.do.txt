INTRO: F# | E E | B | F# F#  x6

F#            E    B    F#
I got a feeling inside
F#            E    B    F#
It's a certain kind
F#            E    B    F#
I feel hot and cold
F#            E    C#   F#
Deep down in my soul

F#            E    B    F#
I said I can't explain
F#            E    B    F#
I'm feeling good enough baby


F#            E    B    F#
I'm dizzy in my head and I'm feeling blue

F#            E    B    F#
Things you say but maybe they're true

F#            E    B    F#
Getting funny dreams again and again
F#            E      C#
I know what it means but

F#
I can't explain
D#m
I think it's love
B
I'm trying to say to you
C#
When I feel blue
F#            E    B   F#
But I can't explain (can't explain)
F#            E    B   F#
Just hear what I'm saying baby (can't explain)

(SOLO 4x intro-riff)

I'm dizzy in the head
And I'm feeling bad
Things you say got me real mad
Getting funny dreams again and again
I know what it means but

I can't explain
I think it's love
I'm trying to say to you
When I feel blue
But I can't explain (can't explain)
Just hear me one more time baby (can't explain)

(SOLO 2x intro-riff)

I'm dizzy in the head
And I'm feeling bad
Things you say got me real mad
Getting funny dreams again and again
I know what it means but

I can't explain
I think it's love
I'm trying to say to you
When I feel blue
But I can't explain (can't explain)
Just hear me one more time baby (can't explain)

F#            E    B    F#
She drive me out of my mind (can't explain)
F#            E    B    F#
She drive me out of my mind (can't explain)
F#            E    B    F#
She drive me out of my mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mind (can't explain)
F#            E    B    F#
She drive me out of my mind (can't explain)
F#            E    B    F#
You drive me out of my mind (can't explain)

F#                     E
Oooh yeah, I can't explain
               F#
I can't explain baby
