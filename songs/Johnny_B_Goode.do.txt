# #ifdef LYRICS
!bc
Way down in Louisiana down to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like he's ringin' a bell

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
And sit beneath the trees by the railroad track
The engineers would see him sittin' in the shade
Strummin' to the rhythm that the driver made
When people passed him by they would stop and say
Oh my that little country boy sure can play

Well his mama told him one day you will be a man
You will be the leader of a big old band
People gonna come from miles around
To listen to your playin' till the sun goes down
And one day maybe your name gonna be in lights
Sayin' Johnny B Goode tonight
